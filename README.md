# Inventory-Updater

This project was developed for internal use at AADCO Medical Inc. in Randolph, Vermont

The Inventory-Updater application was conceptualized, designed, and developed by Brendan Dolan Q1 2017.

Before the Inventory-Updater application was invented, any time a new product, new size, new color, etc. was launched, internal Inventory Administrators at AADCO Medical Company were required to create hundreds of records in excel, completely manually.

After the Inventory-Updater was developed by Brendan Dolan, Inventory Administrators had a quick and painless method for generating new product catalogs, which in turn helped to reduce human-error, reduce man hours, and increase productivity.
