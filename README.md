# Inventory-Updater

This project was developed for internal use at AADCO Medical Inc. in Randolph, Vermont

The Inventory-Updater application was conceptualized, designed, and developed by Brendan Dolan Q1 2017.

Before the Inventory-Updater application was invented, any time a new product, new size, new color, etc. was launched, internal Inventory Administrators at AADCO Medical Company were required to create hundreds of records manually with the updated inventory. 

After the Inventory-Updater was developed by Brendan Dolan, Inventory Administrators had a quick and painless method for generating new product catalogs, reducing human-error, reducing man hours, and increasing productivity.
